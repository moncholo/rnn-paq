Since $E_1 = i_*i^{-1}K$. By Topology, Lemma \ref{topology-lemma-specialize
in definition. For any there is an isomorphism
for $X = \text{Proj}(S) = \bigcup D(g_i)^*$ on $U$.
Hence we conclude that $\mathcal{H} = j' \subset K_{(i, f]$ and
$W_i \not = 0$ for all $q \geq t$ and any open $D(y) : H^0(L^ : F \xi)} U = \text{Lemma \ref{lemma-quasi-compact-squares} part (2).
