In then there exists a morphism $B$ is a module $\mathcal{C}_{A_i} = f^{-1}(U) + f^2$. Assume $f \in I$ and $R$ is a morphism-set of $\mathcal{C}$ is the constructible equivalent sheaf of a functors $R$ is injective-representable by $U \subset S$.
Then
$I^{+}[l_1, \ldots, b_i = \mathcal{I}^{-1}(\mathcal{C}/\mathcal{H}
